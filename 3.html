        <h1>Lesson 3</h1>
        
        <p>We're going to add a whopping nine letters to our arsenal today, starting with six consonants:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>
                    <th>Romanization</th>
                    <th>Class</th>
                </th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ด</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">d</span></td>
                    <td>mid</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ต</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">dt</span></td>
                    <td>mid</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ท</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">t</span></td>
                    <td>high</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">บ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">b</span></td>
                    <td>mid</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ป</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">bp</span></td>
                    <td>mid</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">พ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">p</span></td>
                    <td>high</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p>These sounds can be hard to hear the difference between.</p>

        <p><span lang="th">ท</span> and <span lang="th">พ</span> are our <em>aspirated</em> or <em>puffy</em> sounds. You should make sure to get a good puff of air when you say them.</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details><summary>What consonant classes could they be in and why?</summary> Because they're <em>aspirated</em> or <em>puffy</em>, they could be either high or low-class.</details>
        </div>

        <p>Both of them are low-class. Memorize that!</p>

        <p><span lang="th">ด</span> <span class="rom">d</span> and <span lang="th">ต</span> <span class="rom">dt</span> sound similar <em>and</em> look similar. For <span lang="th">ด</span> <span class="rom">d</span>, give it more "oomph" than you would an English "d". You should feel your vocal cords really vibrating for it. They shouldn't vibrate when you pronounce <span lang="th">ต</span> <span class="rom">dt</span> - there's no oomph at all for this sound. Then, remember the puff of air that comes with <span lang="th">ท</span> <span class="rom">t</span>.</p>

        <p>It's the same deal for <span lang="th">บ</span> <span class="rom">b</span> and <span lang="th">ป</span> <span class="rom">bp</span>. Give <span lang="th">บ</span> <span class="rom">b</span> some oomph and put your vocal cords into it. Then make sure you don't put any oomph into <span lang="th">ป</span> <span class="rom">bp</span> - no vocal cord vibrations for this one. And lastly, <span lang="th">พ</span> <span class="rom">p</span> has a puff of air.</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details><summary>What consonant class are <span lang="th">ด ต บ ป</span> in? Why?</summary> They're mid-class consonants because they're all <em>unaspirated stops</em> or <em>touchy sounds</em>.</details>
        </div>

        <p>With our new letters, try reading these words, being careful about your pronunciation. They're all still mid tone:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ตา</span></summary> <span class="rom">dtaa </span>maternal grandfather</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ตาม</span></summary> <span class="rom">dtaam</span> to follow</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ทา</span></summary> <span class="rom">taa</span> to smear something on something</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">พา</span></summary> <span class="rom">paa</span> to lead someone somewhere</details>
        </div>

        <p>This long <span class="rom">aa</span> is getting boring. But to learn more vowels, we first need to learn this special consonant:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>
                    <th>Romanization</th>
                    <th>Class</th>
                </th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">อ</span></td>
                    <td>nothing!</td>
                    <td>mid</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>It's a silent consonant! Its name is just <span class="rom">ɔɔ</span>. Every Thai vowel needs to be "attached" to something. So if the syllable starts with a vowel, we need to use <span lang="th">อ</span> as a placeholder for the vowel to attach to.</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details><summary>That means we shouldn't have been writing า on its own in lesson 1. How should we have written the syllable aa?</summary> <span lang="th">อา</span></details>
        </div>

        <p><span lang="th">อา</span> <span class="rom">aa</span> is a word, too! It means "uncle".</p>

        <p><span lang="th">อ</span> is a mid-class consonant! Just remember that.</p>

        <p>Let's use <span lang="th">อ</span> to finally introduce some more vowels.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>
                    <th>Romanization</th>
                    <th>Length</th>
                </th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">อี</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">ii</span></td>
                    <td>long</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">อู</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">uu</span></td>
                    <td>long</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Check it out! These vowels don't go to the right of the consonant like <span lang="th">อา</span> does. They go on top and under the consonants they're "attached" to. See how using a consonant like <span lang="th">อ</span> shows us where they attach?</p>

        <p>Try reading these words, again using all mid tone:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ดี</span></summary> <span class="rom">dii</span> good</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ตี</span></summary> <span class="rom">dtii</span> to hit</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ที</span></summary> <span class="rom">tii</span> a time, like "one time"</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">มี</span></summary> <span class="rom">mii</span> to have</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ปี</span></summary> <span class="rom">bpii</span> year</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">บางที</span></summary> <span class="rom">baang-tii</span> sometimes</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">รู</span></summary> <span class="rom">ruu</span> hole</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ดู</span></summary> <span class="rom">duu</span> to look at</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ทูน</span></summary> <span class="rom">tuun</span> to revere or respect</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">งู</span></summary> <span class="rom">nguu</span> snake</details>
        </div>

        <p>Check it out, <span lang="th">บางที</span> is our longest word yet!</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">บางที</span> has two syllables. What are they?</summary> <span lang="th">บาง</span> <span class="rom">baang</span> and <span lang="th">ที</span> <span class="rom">tii</span>.</details>
        </div>

        <p>How did you know where the syllables separated? Here, I bet you just knew: <span class="rom">baang-tii</span> just makes sense. It's not always that easy, but for now - pay attention to where syllables start and end!</p>
