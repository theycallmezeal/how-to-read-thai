        <h1>Lesson 15</h1>

        <p>We're rounding the corner! We've covered all the fundamentals, and in the last quarter of our course, we're going to go over a lot of "side rules" that kind of add on to the strong foundation we've built.</p>

        <p>Today we're going to learn two very important - and common - rules. They both work in similar ways, but one gets used all the time, and the other is only used in four words - really. (At least they're common words.) But first up, remember a few things about consonant classes:</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>What kind of sounds come in high / low pairs?</summary>
                Aspirated stops, or puffy sounds (<span class="rom">p t ch k</span>), and fricatives, or blowy sounds (<span class="rom">f s h</span>).
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary> What kind of sound is always low-class?</summary>
                The sonorants, or sing-y sounds (<span class="rom">m n ng l r y w</span>).
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>Isn't it weird that the sonorants / sing-y sounds don't also have high counterparts? Thing is - they actually do.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, though, we're not going to learn a bunch of letters. Instead, a simple rule: adding an <span lang="th">ห</span> to one of the "sing-y" letters turns it from a low-class to a high-class consonant. (If you're using my <a href="13.html#weirdtonesystem">weird system for tones</a>, adding an <span lang="th">ห</span> turns it from a "normal" consonant to a "weird" consonant!) The "sing-y" letters, as a reminder, are <span lang="th">ม น ณ ง ล ร ย ญ ว</span>. (There's one more we haven't met, <span lang="th">ฬ</span>.)</p>
        
        <p>Let's look at all the things this affects. When I see <span lang="th">หน</span>, I know the <span lang="th">ห</span> that makes it high-class, and high-class consonants have names with rising tone, so I see <span lang="th">หน</span> and I think <span class="rom">nɔ̌ɔ</span>, which gets me into a high-class kind of mood.</p>

        <p>In a live syllable, <span lang="th">หนา</span> <span class="rom">nǎa</span> "thick" has a rising tone, just like its name, <span class="rom">nɔ̌ɔ</span>.</p>

        <o>In a dead syllable, <span lang="th">หนัก</span> <span class="rom">nàk</span> "heavy" has a low tone. (Note that we don't have to care about vowel length here, even though there's a น!)</o>

        <p>With tone mark number one, <span lang="th">หนึ่ง</span> <span class="rom">nʉ̀ng</span> "one" has a low tone.</p>

        <p>And with tone mark number two, <span lang="th">หน้า</span> <span class="rom">nâa</span> "in front of" has a falling tone.</p>

        <p>Check out the spelling. For the first time, we're putting two consonants at the start of a syllable. When we do this, and then we use things that go on top of consonants, like vowels or tone marks, we put them on top of the *second* consonant. We write <span lang="th">หน้า</span>, not <span lang="th">ห้นา</span>.</p>

        <p>But other than that, the two letters stick together, no matter what. So when we use things that go to the left of consonants, like <span lang="th">ไอ</span>, we put them to the left of both consonants: <span lang="th">ไหม</span>.</p>

        <p>And when we use things that go *around* consonants, like <span lang="th">เอา</span>, we put them around both consonants: <span lang="th">เหลา</span>.</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>Here's a challenge. Try combining the consonant <span lang="th">หน</span> with the vowel <span lang="th">เอือ</span>. Where do all the parts go? How do you pronounce the resulting syllable?</summary>
                <span lang="th">เหนือ</span> <span class="rom">nʉ̌ʉa</span> north
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>Let's practice the <span lang="th">ห</span> rule with these words. It's very common! There are a variety of syllable types in there. The three words at the top there all sound very similar, but mean different things!</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ไหม</span></summary> <span class="rom">mǎi</span> silk</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ใหม่</span></summary> <span class="rom">mài</span> new or again</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ไหม้</span></summary> <span class="rom">mâi</span> to burn</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">หยาบ</span></summary> <span class="rom">yàap</span> coarse</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">หมวก</span></summary> <span class="rom">mùuak</span> anything you wear on your head</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">หมด</span></summary> <span class="rom">mòt</span> empty or gone</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">หนี</span></summary> <span class="rom">nǐi</span> to escape</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">หรือ</span></summary> <span class="rom">rʉ̌ʉ</span> or</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">หนุ่ม</span></summary> <span class="rom">nùm</span> young man</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">หลัง</span></summary> <span class="rom">lǎng</span> behind</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">กำหนด</span></summary> <span class="rom">gam-nòt</span> appointment</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ผู้หญิง</span></summary> <span class="rom">pûu-yǐng</span> woman</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">เหมือน</span></summary> <span class="rom">mʉ̌ʉan</span> same</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ระหว่าง</span></summary> <span class="rom">rá-wàang</span> between</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">จังหวัด</span></summary> <span class="rom">jang-wàt</span> province</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">หน้าที่</span></summary> <span class="rom">nâa-tîi</span> duty or responsibility</details>
        </div>

        <p>Sometimes the combos with <span lang="th">ห</span> act as one single high-class consonant, as we've been discussing. But sometimes they're just two letters that are next to each other! Check out the word <span lang="th">เหลา</span>. You can read it as one syllable, <span class="rom">lǎo</span>, with <span lang="th">หล</span> acting as a single thing. But you can also read it like two syllables: <span lang="th">เห-ลา</span> <span class="rom">hěelaa</span>, which is also a word that shares the same spelling.</p>

        <p>Here's another example: <span lang="th">พาหนะ</span> is <span lang="th">พา-ห-นะ</span>, <span class="rom">paa-há-ná</span>, even though the <span lang="th">หน</span> looks like it might go together. Isn't that frustrating? Fortunately, that's kind of rare. In practice, <span lang="th">ห</span> next to a "sing-y" consonant is almost always turning it into a high-class consonant.</p>

        <p>Applying this rule with the <span lang="th">ห</span> is really working our knowledge of the tones! Let's learn the second rule now. It's much simpler.</p>

        <p>There are four words that start with <span lang="th">อย</span>. The <span lang="th">อ</span> combines with the <span lang="th">ย</span> and the two act as a single consonant. You pronounce it like a regular <span lang="th">ย</span>, and - good news! - the tone is always low. Here are the four words, all of which are common:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">อยู่</span></summary> <span class="rom">yùu</span> to be located or to live</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">อย่าง</span></summary> <span class="rom">yàang</span> a variety of something, like or as, or use it with an adjective to make an adverb, like the English -ly</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">อย่า</span></summary> <span class="rom">yàa</span> "don't" in commands, like "don't do that!"</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">อยาก</span></summary> <span class="rom">yàak</span> to want</details>
        </div>

        <p>That's all four of them, and they're all very common. Notice that three of them have tone mark number one on them, but <span lang="th">อยาก</span> doesn't. That's just how you spell them!</p>

        <p>(If you want to be very technical about it, adding the <span lang="th">อ</span> to the <span lang="th">ย</span> turns it into a mid-class consonant. If you look at the four words and pretend they start with a mid-class consonant, then they're all low-tone. I think it's a lot easier, though, to just know that <span lang="th">อย</span> always means low tone, since there are only four words.)</p>

            <p><span lang="th">บ ค ก</span> sound like <span class="rom">p t k</span> at the end of a syllable.</p>
            <p><span lang="th">ห</span> plus a sonorant or sing-y letter makes it high-class.</p>
            <p>Words starting with <span lang="th">อย</span> have low tone.</p>
            <p>When two consonants combine at the start of a syllable, nothing goes between them and they always stay together. Things that are written on top get written on the second consonant.</p>
