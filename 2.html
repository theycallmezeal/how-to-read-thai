        <h1>Lesson 2</h1>
        
        <p>We're about to learn a lot more consonants, which means we're going to have to get organized.</p>

        <p>First, let's think about all the <em>sounds</em> in Thai:</p>

        <p>
            <span class="rom">p t ch k<br>f s h<br>bp dt g b d j<br>m n ng l r y w</span>
        </p>

        <p>It will help to break these up into groups:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><span class="rom">p t ch k</span></dt>
            <dd>These are <em>aspirated stops</em>, or <em>puffy</em> sounds. When you say them, you make a little puff of air - put your hand in front of your mouth to see.</dd>

            <dt><span class="rom">f s h</span></dt>
            <dd>These are <em>fricatives</em>, or <em>blowy</em> sounds. To make them, you have to blow outwards. Try it!</dd>
            
            <dt><span class="rom">bp dt g b d j</span></dt>
            <dd>These are <em>unaspirated stops</em>, or <em>touchy</em> sounds. To make them, you touch different parts of your mouth together and release.</dd>
            
            <dt><span class="rom">m n ng l r y w</span></dt>
            <dd>These are <em>sonorants</em>, or <em>sing-y</em> sounds. You can hold them for a long time, and it's almost like you "sing" them for as long as you hold them.</dd>
            
            <dt><span class="rom">m n ng</span></dt>
            <dd>These three <em>sing-y</em> sounds are also <em>nasals</em>, or <em>nose-y</em> sounds. You actually release air through your nose when you "sing" them. Try it!</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>So what's the big deal? The reason you should know these is because they help you determine the <em>class</em> of a consonant.</p>

        <p>Thai consonant letters are broken up into three <em>classes</em> - low, mid, and high. (Important: the names of the classes have nothing to do with the names of the tones we'll eventually learn.) What class a consonant is in depends on what kind of sound it makes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Consonants that make <em>aspirated</em> or <em>puffy</em> sounds, or <em>fricatives</em> or <em>blowy</em> sounds, can be either low-class or high-class. (There are always at least two letters for these sounds: one low, one high.)</li>
            <li>Consonants that make <em>stops</em> or <em>touchy</em> sounds are mid-class.</li>
            <li>Consonants that make <em>sonorants</em> or <em>sing-y</em> sounds are low-class.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's practice!</p>

        
        <div class="questions">
            <details><summary>What consonant classes are all these consonants in, and why? <span lang="th">ม น ง ย ร</span></summary> They're all low-class because they're sonorants or <em>sing-y</em> sounds.</details>
            <details><summary>What consonant classes could this consonant be in, and why? <span lang="th">ช</span></summary> This is an <em>aspirated stop</em> or <em>puffy</em> sound, so it could be either low or high-class. (For the linguists: yeah, yeah, it's an affricate, but it phonologically patterns like a stop in Thai.)</details>
        </div>

        <p>I'll tell you now that <span lang="th">ช</span> is low-class :) As promised, it has its high-class buddy that also makes the <span class="rom">ch</span> sound. It looks like <span lang="th">ฉ</span>, if you're curious. For now, just remember which is which. All of our consonants are actually going to be low or mid class for now. We'll start working with high-class consonants in unit 5.</p>
       
        <p>And why do we care about consonant classes? Because they matter for tone! This may seem tedious now, but you should get good at remembering what classes all your consonants are in, because you'll need them for tone, and you need tone to be understood.</p>
