        <h1>Lesson 7</h1>
        
        <p>Big lesson today! We're going to talk about tone, vowels, and one of the biggest things to watch out for when you read Thai: live and dead syllables.</p>

        <p>But let's start out with some review:</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>How do you read these vowels again? <span lang="th">อา อี อู</span></summary>
                <span lang="th">อา</span> is <span class="rom">aa</span>, <span lang="th">อี</span> is <span class="rom">ii</span>, and <span lang="th">อู</span> is <span class="rom">uu</span>. They are all long vowels.
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>We've met a lot of long vowels so far. Let's meet our first short vowels:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>
                    <th>Romanization</th>
                    <th>Length</th>
                </th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">อั</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">a</span></td>
                    <td>short</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">อะ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">a</span></td>
                    <td>short</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">อิ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">i</span></td>
                    <td>short</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">อุ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">u</span></td>
                    <td>short</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The long vowels <span lang="th">อี อู</span> look like their short versions, <span lang="th">อิ อุ</span>, with extra little lines. Especially when text is printed small, it can be hard to see the difference. Do your best!</p>

        <p><span lang="th">อั</span> and <span lang="th">อะ</span> make the same sound: <span class="rom">a</span>. You use <span lang="th">อั</span> when there is a consonant at the end of the syllable, and you use <span lang="th">อะ</span> if there isn't. A couple vowels have similar variations depending on whether there's a consonant ending their syllables or not.</p>

        <p>Let's practice the new short vowels. Be careful about tone:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">หัน</span></summary> <span class="rom">hǎn</span> to turn</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ฟัน</span></summary> <span class="rom">fan</span> tooth</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ขัง</span></summary> <span class="rom">kǎng</span> to keep something confined</details>

            <details><summary><span lang="th">ชิง</span></summary> <span class="rom">ching</span> to snatch away or compete</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ยุง</span></summary> <span class="rom">yung</span> mosquito</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">จัง</span></summary> <span class="rom">jang</span> very; so</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">อัน</span></summary> <span class="rom">an</span> a classifier for small objects</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ยิง</span></summary> <span class="rom">ying</span> to shoot a weapon</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">สิน</span></summary> <span class="rom">sǐn</span> wealth</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">กิน</span></summary> <span class="rom">gin</span> to eat or drink</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">รัง</span></summary> <span class="rom">rang</span> nest</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">วัง</span></summary> <span class="rom">wang</span> palace</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ดิน</span></summary> <span class="rom">din</span> dirt</details>
        </div>

        <p>Now let's move on to the big thing I promised you we'd talk about: live and dead syllables. Every syllable in Thai can be called either "live" or "dead", and it's important to know which is which, because it affects tone!</p>

        <p>So far, every single syllable we've read is live. What makes a syllable dead? Remember this:</p>

        <div class="rules">
            <p>A dead syllable ends in either one short vowel or a <span class="rom">p</span>, <span class="rom">t</span>, or <span class="rom">k</span>. All other syllables are live.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Before we meet our first dead syllable, let's backtrack through a few words we've met before. As I mentioned, everything we've read so far has been live. Let's make sure we know why:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span lang="th">โคม</span> - this word ends in an <span class="rom">m</span>. That's not something a dead syllable can end in.</li>
            <li><span lang="th">ไถ</span> - this words ends in two short vowels: <span class="rom">ai</span>. To be dead, this would need only one short vowel.</li>
            <li><span lang="th">กา</span> - this word ends in a long vowel: <span class="rom">aa</span>. To be dead, this would need to end in a single short vowel.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So what's so special about dead syllables? Their tone changes!</p>

        <div class="rules">
            <p>Dead syllables starting with low-class consonants have high tone*.</p>
            <p>Dead syllables starting with mid-class consonants have low tone.</p>
            <p>Dead syllables starting with high-class consonants have low tone.</p>
        </div>

        <p>(*There's more to this rule, because of course there is, but we'll get there soon enough.)</p>

        <p>Sit with that for a moment: this is very important. Now, to determine the tone of a syllable, you've got to look at both the first letter and what comes at the end - checking if it's live or dead, and using both to figure out the tone.</p>

        <p>It's kind of a lot, especially to start out! I promise it gets easier with time. Let's read a few words with dead syllables.</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ละ</span></summary> <span class="rom">lá</span> per</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ดุ</span></summary> <span class="rom">dù</span> to scold</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">คะ</span></summary> <span class="rom">ká</span> a question particle used by women</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">กะ</span></summary> <span class="rom">gà</span> to measure</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">นะ</span></summary> <span class="rom">ná</span> a particle that kind of means "isn't it?"</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">จะ</span></summary> <span class="rom">já</span> a particle that kind of means "going to" or "could"</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">อะไร</span></summary> <span class="rom">à-rai</span> what</details>
        </div>

        <p>Make sure you recognize why each syllable is dead!</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>There is one live syllable mixed in with the above words to keep things interesting. Can you find it, say why it's live, and read it with the correct tone?</summary>
                <span lang="th">อะไร</span> <span class="rom">à-rai</span> has two syllables. <span lang="th">อะ</span> is a dead syllable that starts with a mid-class consonant, so it's low tone <span class="rom">à</span>. But <span lang="th">ไร</span> is a live syllable that starts with a low-class consonant, so it's mid tone <span class="rom">rai</span>.
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>This was a big day, so let's recap what we've learned:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>short and long vowels</li>
            <li>live and dead syllables</li>
            <li>determining the tone of dead syllables</li>
        </ul>
