        <h1>Lesson 1</h1>
        
        <p>Let's start things off with two letters:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>
                    <th>Romanization</th>
                </th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ม</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">m</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">า</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">aa</span></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Note that we have a <em>long</em> <span class="rom">aa</span>. As you'll see later, long and short vowels are different!</p>

        <p>Now read this word:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">มา</span></summary><span class="rom">maa</span> come</details>
        </div>

        <p>Awesome! This word has a <em>mid tone</em>. It should be level and in the middle of your vocal range. We'll find out why it's mid tone later.</p>

        <p>We can do a lot with this long <span class="rom">aa</span>. Here are some more consonants to play with: five more of 'em:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>
                    <th>Romanization</th>
                </th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">น</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">n</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ง</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">ng</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ช</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">ch</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ย</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">y</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ร</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">r</span></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p><span lang="th">ม</span> and <span lang="th">น</span> look really similar. The "m" has the loopy part on the left, and the "n" has the loopy part on the right.</p>

        <p>Let's practice our new letters. Try reading these words, all of which also have mid tone:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">งาน</span></summary> <span class="rom">ngaan</span> work / job</details>
            <details id="name"><summary><span lang="th">นาม</span></summary> <span class="rom">naam</span> name (a formal word. The normal word meaning "name" is <span lang="th">ชื่อ</span> <span class="rom">chʉ̂ʉ</span>. You don't know how to read this yet, but do you recognize a letter?)</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ชา</span></summary> <span class="rom">chaa</span> tea</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">งาม</span></summary> <span class="rom">ngaam</span> beautiful</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ยา</span></summary> <span class="rom">yaa</span> medicine</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">นา</span></summary> <span class="rom">naa</span> rice paddy</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ยาม</span></summary> <span class="rom">yaam</span> guard or period of time</details>
        </div>

        <p>Did you notice that <span lang="th">ง</span> <span class="rom">ng</span> can be at the start of a word? This can be kind of hard to pronounce. If you're having trouble, try using an English word with "ng", like "sing", to transition into the Thai "ng": try saying, sing-<span lang="th">งาน</span>. sing-<span class="rom">ngaan</span>. Practice getting into position with the English word, then hold it, pause, and say the Thai word.</p>

        <p>Here's our longest word yet:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ราชา</span></summary> <span class="rom">raa-chaa</span> king</details>
        </div>

        <p>This word is two syllables! Both syllables, the <span lang="th">รา</span> <span class="rom">raa</span> and the <span lang="th">ชา</span> <span class="rom">chaa</span>, have mid tone.</p>

        <p>Syllables are very important in Thai! Note that some syllables are consonant-vowel, like <span lang="th">นา</span> <span class="rom">naa</span>, while others are consonant-vowel-consonant, like <span lang="th">ยาม</span> <span class="rom">yaam</span>.</p>

        <p>Let's review what we've learned! When you say the names of the consonants we've met so far, you add <span class="rom">ɔɔ</span> to the end of it and use a mid tone. <span lang="th">ย</span> is <span class="rom">yɔɔ</span>, for example.</p>

        <p>The letters all have "official" names that incorporate a word that has that letter. <span lang="th">ย</span> is <span lang="th">ย ยักษ์</span> <span class="rom">yɔɔ yák</span>, for example. You don't have to memorize the official names of all the letters, but many of them incorporate objects important to Thai culture. They're listed in the <a href="appendix.html#alphabetical">appendix</a> if you're curious.</p>
