        <h1>Lesson 8</h1>
        
        <p>At the end of lesson 6, we said we were done learning all the common consonants. We also said the rest of the consonants were super rare. Just because they're rare doesn't mean they're cool, though - while we'll be learning most of them near the tail end of the course, I want to give you a sneak preview of two of the cooler-looking rare consonants:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>
                    <th>Romanization</th>
                </th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ฎ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">d</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ฏ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">dt</span></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>These two letters look really similar. <span lang="th">ฏ</span> has an extra little bumpy bit on the bottom part.</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>I didn't tell you what class they're in on purpose. Based on the sounds they make, what class are they?</summary>
                They're <em>unaspirated stops</em> or <em>touchy</em> sounds, so they're mid-class.
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What other consonants do you know that make the same sounds and are in the same class?</summary>
                <span lang="th">ด</span> <span class="rom">d</span> and <span lang="th">ต</span> <span class="rom">dt</span>.
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>Just like <span lang="th">ภ</span> and <span lang="th">พ</span>, we now have more consonants that behave just like each other. It's a spelling thing: you just have to know which words use which letters.</p>

        <p>Like I said, <span lang="th">ฎ</span> and <span lang="th">ฏ</span> are... really, really rare. They only appear in words borrowed from the Indian languages Sanskrit and Pali, which massively influenced the language as Thailand was influenced by Indian culture. Sanskrit and Pali have a lot of letters that represent sounds that Thai doesn't have. Although words with these letters changed to fit Thai pronunciation, people still wanted to preserve the spelling. So <span lang="th">ฎ</span> and <span lang="th">ฏ</span> are used when the original Sanskrit / Pali word used different d and t sounds that Thai doesn't have. We'll wait till later in the course to learn the rest of the Sanskrit / Pali letters!</p>

        <p>Here are some words that use these letters. They're super uncommon. I had to look pretty hard to find words that fit. Remember to look out for consonant classes and live and dead syllables to figure out tone:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ฎีกา</span></summary> <span class="rom">dii-gaa</span> petition to the king (told you these words were rare!)</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">โฏฏะ</span></summary> <span class="rom">dtoo-dtà</span> very small</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">กุฏิ</span></summary> <span class="rom">gù-dtì</span> monk house</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ภูฏาน</span></summary> <span class="rom">puu-dtaan</span> Bhutan</details>
        </div>

        <p>Let's move on. We're going to go from two very rare letters to a very common part of Thai writing: <em>inherent</em> or <em>unwritten</em> vowels.</p>

        <p>We're used to syllables that have vowels in them. But sometimes, you get a syllable that has no vowel in it! How do you read it then? We have a rule:</p>

        <div class="rules">
            <p>If there's one letter, you add a short <span class="rom">a</span> to the end. </p>
            <p>If there's two letters, you add a short <span class="rom">o</span> in between them.</p>
            <p>We call these unwritten <span class="rom">a</span>'s and <span class="rom">o</span>'s <em>inherent vowels</em>.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Here are a few words with inherent vowels. Give them a go, being mindful of tone.</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">คน</span></summary> <span class="rom">kon</span> person</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">มหา</span></summary> <span class="rom">má-hǎa</span> grand or great</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ผม</span></summary> <span class="rom">pǒm</span> a polite word for "I" used by men</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">นม</span></summary> <span class="rom">nom</span> milk</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">สม</span></summary> <span class="rom">sǒm</span> suitable</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ดง</span></summary> <span class="rom">dong</span> jungle, or to put rice back over low heat after draining it so it can finish cooking (yes, really)</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ชฎา</span></summary> <span class="rom">chá-daa</span> a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maku%E1%B9%ADa">fancy headpiece</a></details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ตุลาคม</span></summary> <span class="rom">dtù-laa-kom</span> October</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ยาปฏิชีวนะ</span></summary> <span class="rom">yaa-bpà-dtì-chii-wá-ná</span> antibiotics (<span lang="th">ยา</span> means medicine, <span lang="th">ปฏิ</span> means against or anti, and <span lang="th">ชีวนะ</span> means life, like an organism.)</details>
        </div>

        <p>That last word was a whopping six syllables, our longest word yet!</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, it's tricky when multiple syllables come next to each other. For example, how did you know <span lang="th">นม</span> was one syllable and not two? Answer: you couldn't. I had to tell you.</p>

        <p>Let's make it harder: can you find the syllables in this word?</p>

        <p><span lang="th">กรกฎาคม</span></p>

        <p>It's tricky, right? You might have guessed <span lang="th">กร-ก-ฎาค-ม</span> or <span lang="th">ก-รก-ฎา-คม</span> or a whole host of other guesses. You can't tell just by looking at the word!</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, you just have to know the word. More generally: </p>
        
        <div class="rules">
            <p>You cannot always determine the syllables, and therefore the pronunciation, of every word from the spelling alone.</p>
        </div>

        <p>There's one hint in this word: the vowel <span lang="th">า</span>. Vowels attach to consonants. So at least we know <span lang="th">ฎ</span> and <span lang="th">า</span> are part of the same syllable. But inherent vowels give us no help!</p>

        <p>In the real world, you just kinda make educated guesses, learn how words are spelled as you go, and it's really not that bad. For this word, you just have to know that it breaks up like this:

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ก-ร-ก-ฎา-คม</span></summary> <span class="rom">gà-rá-gà-daa-kom</span> July</details>
        </div>

        <p>That's right, after going on and on about how <span lang="th">ฎ</span> is rare, here it is in the very common word for a month. I see two different kinds of inherent vowels in this word. This one's extra hard because there are a few consonant classes and live and dead syllables. Go slow!</p>
