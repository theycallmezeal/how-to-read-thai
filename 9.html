        <h1>Lesson 9</h1>
        
        <p>This lesson's an important one: After today, we'll be able to read just about any Thai word that doesn't have tone marks. Because of it, let's take a breather at the end of this lesson and recap, too.</p>

        <p>As you've already seen, there's a lot you need to think about: consonant classes, long and short vowels, live and dead syllables... and then the twist we're going to learn today. This is the top of the difficulty hill! If you can take inventory after this lesson and feel confident, you can absolutely do the rest.</p>

        Remember these three consonants?

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>What sounds do the letters <span lang="th">บ ค ก</span> make?</summary>
                <span lang="th">บ</span> is b, <span lang="th">ค</span> is d, and <span lang="th">ก</span> is g.
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>Thai has a lot of consonant sounds. You can use all of them at the start of a syllable, but only a few consonant sounds are allowed at the end of a syllable. Here they are: <span class="rom">m n ng p t k</span>.</p>

        <p>We've been using <span class="rom">m</span>, <span class="rom">n</span>, and <span class="rom">ng</span> plenty at the end of a syllable. We haven't seen the <span class="rom">p</span>, <span class="rom">t</span>, or <span class="rom">k</span> yet. An important pronunciation note: when the sounds <span class="rom">p</span>, <span class="rom">t</span>, or <span class="rom">k</span> are at the end of a syllable, they lose their puff of air and just kind of stop short. Compare the English words hip, hit, and hick. You also don't pronounce a puff of air there. Same deal.</p>

        <p>Even though these sounds are <span class="rom">p</span>, <span class="rom">t</span>, and <span class="rom">k</span>, it's actually most common to use the letters <span lang="th">บ ค ก</span> to spell them at the end of a syllable. <span lang="th">บ</span> is <span class="rom">p</span> at the end of a syllable, <span lang="th">ค</span> is <span class="rom">t</span>, and <span lang="th">ก</span> is <span class="rom">k</span>.</p>

        <p>Pop quiz:</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>Pop quiz: What's special about syllables ending in <span class="rom">p</span>, <span class="rom">t</span>, and <span class="rom">k</span>?</summary>
                They are dead syllables.
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What are the tones in those dead syllables?</summary>
                Dead syllables starting with low-class consonants get high tone.<br>
                Dead syllables starting with mid or high-class consonants get low tone.
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>Remember that <span lang="th">บ ค ก</span> are pronounced differently at the end of a syllable and make a syllable dead. Also remember those tone rules and what we learned about inherent vowels last time - and give these words a go:</p>

        </div>

        <p>Nice! As you can see, <span lang="th">บ ค ก</span> are very common at the ends of syllables. We've opened up a lot in what we're able to read.</p>

        <p>Here's the final piece of the puzzle: there is an exception, because of course there is. And it's an important rule:</p>

        <div class="rules">
            <p>If a dead syllable starts with a low-class consonant, and has a <em>long</em> vowel, it will have falling tone.</p>
        </div>

        <p>That's a lot to keep track of - three elements that combine to create falling tone. An example word is <span lang="th">มีด</span> <span class="rom">mîit</span>, which means "knife". It starts with an <span lang="th">ม</span>, which is a low-class consonant. It has <span lang="th">อี</span>, a long vowel, and it's dead, since it ends in <span lang="th">ด</span>. That means it's falling tone.</p>

        <p>The only way this falling-tone rule ever comes into play is if the syllable ends with a <span class="rom">p</span>, <span class="rom">t</span>, or <span class="rom">k</span>. Why? Because we need a long vowel, and if the syllable ended in anything else - the long vowel or an <span class="rom">m</span>, <span class="rom">n</span>, or <span class="rom">ng</span> - the syllable would be live, not dead. If it helps, you can think of this rule as <em>low-class + long vowel + <span class="rom">p t k</span> = falling tone</em>.</p>

        <p>Let's look at the full picture of dead syllables:</p>

        <div class="rules">
            <p>If a dead syllable starts with a...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>low consonant, it has high tone if the vowel is short, and falling tone if the vowel is long.</li>
                <li>mid consonant, it has low tone.</li>
                <li>high consonant, it has low tone.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Let's compare dead syllables that start with low-class consonants. If the vowel is short, the tone is high: <span lang="th">มิด</span> <span class="rom">mít</span> "tightly". But if the vowel is long, the tone is falling: <span lang="th">มีด</span> <span class="rom">mîit</span> "knife".</p>

        <p>My mnemonic is that in a short syllable, the tone doesn't have enough time to fall, so it gets cut off while it's still high. In a long syllable, the tone has plenty of time to fall all the way down.</p>

        <p>(This isn't a perfect mnemonic, because as we'll see in later lessons, syllables with short vowels can totally have falling tone. But I hope this helps you remember this weird rule!)</p>

        <p>Remember, you don't need to worry about this if the dead syllable starts with a mid- or high-class consonant. Those syllables are always low tone.</p>

        <p>Keeping all this in mind, try reading these words. Some have the falling-tone rule. Others are red herrings. It's a mixed bag with this set of words, so watch your tones:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">พูด</span></summary> <span class="rom">pûut</span> to speak</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ขีด</span></summary> <span class="rom">kìit</span> to draw</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">กับ</span></summary> <span class="rom">gàp</span> with</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ชีวิต</span></summary> <span class="rom">chii-wít</span> life</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ชนิด</span></summary> <span class="rom">chá-nít</span> a type of something</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ขาด</span></summary> <span class="rom">kàat</span> to be missing</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">สิบ</span></summary> <span class="rom">sìp</span> ten</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">มาก</span></summary> <span class="rom">mâak</span> very; a lot</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ฝาก</span></summary> <span class="rom">fàak</span> to deposit</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ลูก</span></summary> <span class="rom">lûuk</span> child</details>
        </div>

        <div class="rules"><p>By the way, what about diphthongs? Sneak preview: there are diphthongs made of both short and long vowels. We've only met <span class="rom">ai</span>, which is made of two short vowels. There are also long diphthongs like <span class="rom">iia</span> and <span class="rom">uua</span>. For reasons we won't get into, Thai only allows long diphthongs before an ending consonant. They count as long for tone rules, and - I mean - they're pretty obviously long.</p></div>

        <p>The tone rules are starting to stack up, so I'm going to organize them in a chart, like this:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th rowspan="3">First consonant</th>
                <th colspan="3">Tone</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th rowspan="2">live</th>
                <th colspan="2">dead</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>short</th>
                <th>long</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>low-class</td>
                <td>mid</td>
                <td>high</td>
                <td>falling</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>mid-class</td>
                <td>mid</td>
                <td colspan="2">low</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>high-class</td>
                <td>rising</td>
                <td colspan="2">low</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>I like visualizing information, and I have this chart memorized. When I need to think about tone, I pull this picture up in my head and figure out where on the chart I am. Try this strategy out and see if you like it!</p>

        <p>Let's take that breather I promised you. This is a great stopping point to let things sink in. You now know about:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>consonant classes, and the logic behind how they're organized</li>
            <li>long and short vowels</li>
            <li>live and dead syllables</li>
            <li>consonants at the ends of syllables</li>
            <li>how all of the above affect tone</li>
            <li>inherent vowels</li>
            <li>funky Sanskrit letters, a few spelling rules, and other intricacies</li>
            <li>and a whole lot of letters!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You've learned a whole lot about how the Thai alphabet works! And if you can do everything in this list, everything else will fall into place quite naturally onto the rock-solid foundation you've built in these first nine lessons. Great work!</p>
