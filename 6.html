        <h1>Lesson 6</h1>
        
        <p>Lesson 5 was a doozy! Let's have a more easygoing lesson today. Take this opportunity to review the new letters from lesson 5, and most importantly, the tone rule.</p>

        <p>All we're doing today is five consonants. Here are two of the new ones, both of which look annoyingly close to <span lang="th">ถ</span>:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>
                    <th>Romanization</th>
                    <th>Class</th>
                </th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ภ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">p</span></td>
                    <td>low</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ก</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">g</span></td>
                    <td>mid</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p><span lang="th">ภ</span> and <span lang="th">พ</span> make the same sound <em>and</em> are in the same class! What's the difference, then? Spelling. You just have to know which words use which letter.</p>

        <p>Here are some words that use the two new letters:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ภาคี</span></summary> <span class="rom">paa-kii</span> member</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">กา</span></summary> <span class="rom">gaa</span> crow (the bird)</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ภู</span></summary> <span class="rom">puu</span> mound</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">กาง</span></summary> <span class="rom">gaang</span> to spread out</details>
        </div>

        <p>Here's another new letter:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>
                    <th>Romanization</th>
                    <th>Class</th>
                </th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ษ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">s</span></td>
                    <td>high</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>This is a high-class letter <span class="rom">s</span>. What other high-class letter <span class="rom">s</span> have we already met? What's the low-class letter <span class="rom">s</span> again?</summary>
                <span lang="th">ส</span> is high-class and <span lang="th">ซ</span> is low-class!
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>This letter isn't as common as the high-class <span class="rom">s</span> we've already met, but we can still have some fun with it. Remember what being high-class does to the tone:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ภาษา</span></summary> <span class="rom">paa-sǎa</span> language</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ภาษี</span></summary> <span class="rom">paa-sǐi</span> tax</details>
        </div>

        <p>Now, the last two letters. They're another one of our low/high-class pairs:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>
                    <th>Romanization</th>
                    <th>Class</th>
                </th>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ฟ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">f</span></td>
                    <td>low</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ฝ</span></td>
                    <td><span class="rom">f</span></td>
                    <td>high</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>These letters are actually based on <span lang="th">พ</span> and <span lang="th">ผ</span>, another low and high pair - the <span class="rom">f</span> letters are just taller on the right. Try them out in these words, being mindful of what the two different classes mean for tone:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ฝา</span></summary> <span class="rom">fǎa</span> lid</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ไฟ</span></summary> <span class="rom">fai</span> fire</details>
        </div>

        <p>Let's bring it home with this very long and important word. There's a spelling quirk in there, but try sounding this out:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ภาษาไทย</span></summary> <span class="rom">paa-sǎa tai</span> the Thai language</details>
        </div>

        <p>Sounding out the word <span lang="th">ไทย</span>, you hopefully figured out that it goes <span class="rom">t-ai-y</span>. When you say that out loud, the <span class="rom">y</span> sound kind of disappears and leaves just <span class="rom">tai</span>.</p>

        <p>Why not just write <span lang="th">ไท</span>? Spelling. A few words with <span lang="th">ไอ</span> just do that - they have an extra <span lang="th">ย</span> at the end that kind of "blends in". We'll learn more about <span lang="th">ย</span> at the end of a word later in the course.</p>

        <p>Practice breaking this up into syllables! Make sure you recognize that <span lang="th">ไทย</span> is all one syllable.</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>What are the syllables of <span lang="th">ภาษาไทย</span>?</summary>
                <span lang="th">ภา-ษา-ไทย</span>. <span class="rom">paa-saa tai</span>.
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>Believe it or not, that's all the consonants! Kind of. We've covered all the consonants that are common. As we'll see in future lessons, the rest of the consonants are kind of rare. In our next few lessons, we're about to tackle some of the most complex parts of Thai writing, and the consonants we have in our arsenal will be more than plenty to learn them.</p>
