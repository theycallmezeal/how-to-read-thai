        <h1>Lesson 5</h1>
        
        <p>Let's meet two new letters.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Letter</th>

                <tr>
                    <td><span lang="th">ซ</span></td>

                    <td>low</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>low</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>What kind of sound are they? What classes could these letters be in?</summary>
                They are <em>fricatives</em> or <em>blowy</em> sounds, so they could be low or high-class.
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>You'll have to remember that they are low-class consonants! These letters are mostly used in loanwords. Try reading these words. Some will sound familiar!</p>

            <details>
                <summary>Remember the letters <span lang="th">ค ท</span>? What class are they?</summary>
                <span lang="th">ค</span> is <span class="rom">k</span> and <span lang="th">ท</span> is <span class="rom">t</span>. They're both low-class.
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What kind of sound do they make? What's the other consonant class that letters with these sounds <em>could</em> make?</summary>
                They're both <em>aspirated stops</em> or <em>puffy</em> sounds. Letters with these sounds could be either low-class or high-class.
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    What are the two kinds of sounds whose letters <em>could</em> be low-class or high-class?
                </summary>
                <em>Aspirated stops</em> / <em>puffy</em> sounds and <em>fricatives</em> / <em>blowy</em> sounds.
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>So far, all the aspirated stop and fricative letters (puffy and blowy sounds) we've learned have been low-class. However, each of these sounds will actually have two letters: one low-class and one high-class. So let's review all of these low-class letters and meet their high-class buddies:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Sound</th>
                    <th>Low-class letter</th>
                    <th>High-class letter</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><span class="rom">p</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">พ</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ผ</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span class="rom">t</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ท</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ถ</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span class="rom">ch</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ช</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ฉ</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span class="rom">k</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ค</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ข</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span class="rom">s</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ซ</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ส</span></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span class="rom">h</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ฮ</span></td>
                    <td><span lang="th">ห</span></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Some letters look really similar! Take note of these for now. I have all the consonants sorted out by shape in the <a href="appendix.html#consonantsbyshape">appendix</a>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span lang="th">ข ช ซ บ ป</span></li>
            <li><span lang="th">ด ต ค</span></li>
            <li><span lang="th">พ ผ</span></li>
            <li><span lang="th">อ ฮ</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that only the aspirated stops and fricatives (puffy and blowy sounds) have both low-class and high-class letters. We've met lots of other low-class consonants that make other sounds, but they don't have high-class buddies.</p>

        <p>So why does class matter? The answer: <em>tone</em>. For now (we'll be adding to this later), here's the rule:</p>

        <div class="rules">
            <ul>
                <li>Syllables starting with low or mid-class consonants have mid tone.</li>
                <li>Syllables starting with high-class consonants have rising tone.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>At last, we've broken free of the mid tone! We're now playing with two out of five total tones, and we've met consonants in all three consonant classes - low, mid, and high. This is a big day!</p>

        <p>Note that the <em>names</em> of the consonant classes have no relation to the tone of the syllables they're in! As you've seen, low-class consonants can give us syllables with mid tone, for example.</p>

        How can you remember which letters are low or high-class? My suggestion: use the names of the letters. The names of the high-class letters are pronounced with rising tone; the others use mid tone. <span lang="th">ซ</span> is <span class="rom">sɔɔ</span>, but <span lang="th">ส</span> is <span class="rom">sɔ̌ɔ</span>.

        <p>Here are some words with our new high-class consonants. Remember to read their syllables with rising tone. Caution: there are some syllables that don't start with high-class consonants mixed in! Remember the rule.</p>
