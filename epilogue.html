        <h1>Epilogue</h1>

        <p>That's it! That's really, honestly, it. Everything we've learned will cover, like, 99% of Thai. And it's a lot! We know about:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>all 42 consonants, even the really rare Sanskrit / Pali ones</li>
            <li>consonant classes, and what kinds of sounds go in which classes</li>
            <li>live and dead syllables</li>
            <li>long and short vowels</li>
            <li>tone marks</li>
            <li>how to figure out tone by looking at consonant classes, live and dead syllables, long and short vowels, <em>and</em> tone marks</li>
            <li>vowel "bonuses"</li>
            <li>the <span lang="th">ห</span> rule and the four <span lang="th">อย</span> words</li>
            <li>consonants at the end of a syllable</li>
            <li>consonant clusters</li>
            <li>those pesky hidden-a clusters</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This epilogue is devoted to the 1% of words that don't follow these rules. Before I get into them, though, take a moment to be proud of yourself for how much you already can do. The rest of these exceptions? Honestly, who cares.</p>
            
        <p>Please don't memorize any of these exceptions; they're rare enough that I didn't teach them in the main lessons. With the rock-solid foundation you've built reading the words that <em>do</em> behave, I think you'll find that you'll be able to just roll with the exceptions.</p>

        <h2>"Phonetic Thai" spellings</h2>

        <p>A lot of words are spelled so weird that in dictionaries you will see them written out phonetically with more "normal" spellings. For example, you'll see <span lang="th">สมัย</span>, with a hidden-a cluster, written <span lang="th">สะ-ไหม</span>, which is more obviously <span class="rom">sà-mǎi</span>.</p>

        <p>This isn't a standardized system at all - mostly it's just common sense, but I write more about it in the <a href="appendix.html#phoneticthai">appendix</a>.</p>

        <p>"Phonetic Thai" is helpful when dealing with the exceptional spellings below. You'll see it in dictionaries and maybe in your learning materials too.</p>

        <h2>Tone marks three and four</h2>

        <p>There are two more tone marks. They're pretty rare, and they only appear in syllables starting with mid-class consonants. They're called <span lang="th">ไม้ตรี</span> <span class="rom">máai dtrii</span> and <span lang="th">ไม้จัตวา</span> <span class="rom">máai jàt-dtà-waa</span>, using the Sanskrit words for three and four.</p>

        <p>Tone mark three looks like this: <span lang="th">อ๊</span>, like tone mark two with an extra little squiggle. It makes everything high tone.</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">โต๊ะ</span></summary> <span class="rom">dtó</span> table</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ซีอิ๊ว</span></summary> <span class="rom">sii íu</span> soy sauce</details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">แก๊ส</span></summary> <span class="rom">gɛ́ɛt</span> gas</details>
        </div>

        <p>Tone mark four looks like a plus sign: <span lang="th">อ๋</span>. It makes everything rising tone.</p>
        
        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">เดี๋ยว</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">กระเป๋า</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ลูกเต๋า</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
        </div>

        <p>Rare though they may be, you never have to worry about consonant class or anything with tone marks three and four. Number three is high and number four is rising, every time!</p>

        <h2>Unexpected high tones</h2>

        <p>A few common words will look like they're rising tone, but they're really high tone. Here are some examples, with "phonetic Thai" to help you.

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ฉัน</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">เขา</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ไหม</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">หนังสือ</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>

        </div>

        <p>No predicting these! Just learn these words as they come.</p>

        <h2 id="lengthisweird">Vowel length is just weird, plus the vowel-shortener spelling rule</h2>

        <p>Sometimes vowels lie to you too, and it'll look like it's one length, but it's really another.</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">เงิน</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">น้ำ</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ต้อง</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">เก้า</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ได้</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
        </div>

        <p>This is particularly common when a word "should" have a <span lang="th">อ็</span> on it. There's a spelling rule with <span lang="th">อ็</span>: if there's something else already on top, you don't write <span lang="th">อ็</span>. This could be a tone mark or a vowel.</p>

        <h2>Silent letters</h2>

        <p>Meet this little loopy guy: <span lang="th">อ์</span>. This is used to indicate that a consonant is silent.</p>

        <p>You see this often in Sanskrit, Pali, and English words where the spelling is preserved but the sounds aren't pronounced in Thai:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">โทรศัพท์</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ดอลลาร์</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">เบียร์</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
        </div>

        <p>Rarely, letters are silent and don't have the อ์ on it. This goes for both consonants or the vowels อิ and อุ.</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">สามารถ</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ประวัติ</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">กษัตริย์</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ศรีราชา</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            
        </div>

        <h2><span lang="th">ทร</span></h2>

        <p><span lang="th">ทร</span> is a special combination that sometimes, but not always, sounds like <span class="rom">s</span>.</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ทราบ</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ทรง</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
        </div>

        <h2><span lang="th">ฤ</span></h2>

        The name of this letter is <span lang="th">รึ</span> <span class="rom">rʉ</span>. It can make the sounds <span lang="th">รึ</span> <span class="rom">rʉ</span>, <span lang="th">ริ</span> <span class="rom">ri</span>, or <span lang="th">เรอ</span> <span class="rom">rəə</span>, depending on the word. Note that this letter can be short or long, which affects tone rules as you'd expect.

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ภาษาอังกฤษ (อังกริด)</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
        </div>

        <p>It has a long version, <span lang="th">ฤๅ</span>, which can be read <span class="rom">rʉʉ</span> or <span class="rom">rii</span>, and there's also <span lang="th">ฦ</span> <span class="rom">lʉ</span> and <span lang="th">ฦๅ</span> <span class="rom">lʉʉ</span>. You will literally never see these.</p>

        <h2>Double consonants</h2>

        <p>Sometimes, when a word would "normally" have two of the same consonant next to each other, the word is spelled with just one instead.</p>

        <p>Take the word <span lang="th">มัสมั่น</span>, which is massaman curry (delicious!). It's pronounced like it's <span lang="th">มัสสมั่น</span>, but that's a double consonant, so it gets written with only one <span lang="th">ส</span> instead.</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">นิตยสาร</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ปัจฉิมบท</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
        </div>

        <h2><span lang="th">ร</span> and <span lang="th">รร</span></h2>

        <p><span lang="th">ร</span> at the end of a syllable sometimes stands for <span lang="th">ออน</span> <span class="rom">ɔɔn</span>.</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">นคร</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
        </div>

        <p><span lang="th">รร</span> at the end of a syllable stands for <span lang="th">อัน</span> <span class="rom">an</span>.</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">พรรษา</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
        </div>
        
        <p><span lang="th">รร</span> with a consonant after it stands for <span lang="th">อั</span> <span class="rom">a</span>.</p>
        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">ธรรม</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
        </div>

        <h2><span lang="th">ก็</span></h2>

        The word <span lang="th">ก็</span> means "also" or "so / therefore" and is pronounced <span lang="th">เก้าะ</span> <span class="rom">gɔ̂</span> despite its weird spelling.

        <h2>Two letters you'll never see</h2>

        <p>There are two letters of the Thai alphabet that basically got yeeted out: <span lang="th">ฃ</span> and <span lang="th">ฅ</span>. They look a lot like <span lang="th">ข</span> and <span lang="th">ค</span>, and they used to function exactly the same. But when Thai typewriters were created, there was no room for all 44 letters, so two had to be left out, and nobody has used these two letters ever since. Words that used to have them are now spelled with regular ol' <span lang="th">ข</span> and <span lang="th">ค</span>.</p>

        <h2>Phinthu, the dot that lives in dictionaries</h2>

        <p>In dictionaries, sometimes the <span lang="th">ห</span> from the <span lang="th">ห</span> rule and the <span lang="th">อ</span> in the four <span lang="th">อย</span> words have a little dot placed under them: <span lang="th">อฺ</span>. It's called <span lang="th">พินทุ</span> <span class="rom">pin-tu</span>, which is often spelled "phinthu" in English. It just indicates that the <span lang="th">ห</span> and <span lang="th">อ</span> aren't regular letters you should pronounce. <span lang="th">พินทุ</span> is never used in real life.</p>

        <h2 id="hiddena">Hidden-a clusters without the tone "borrowing"</h2>

        <p>Remember the normal hidden-a cluster rule? You make the first syllable by adding <span lang="th">อะ</span> to the first consonant. Then you "borrow" the consonant class of the first consonant and pretend the second syllable starts with that consonant class.</p>

        <p>As it turns out, you only "borrow" the first consonant's class if the second consonant is a sonorant or "sing-y" sound - <span class="rom">m n ng r l y w</span>. If the second consonant is anything else, you just read the second syllable as normal.</p>

        <p><span lang="th">แสดง</span>, for example, becomes <span lang="th">สะ-แดง</span>, where there's no tone borrowing and we read <span lang="th">แดง</span> as normal: <span class="rom">sà-dɛɛng</span>. We still have to recognize the hidden-a cluster, though; it's not <span lang="th">แส-ดง</span>.</p>

        <p>Try out these words:</p>

        <div class="words">
            <details><summary><span lang="th">เฉพาะ</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
            <details><summary><span lang="th">แสตมป์</span></summary> <span class="rom"></span> </details>
        </div>

        <h2>Tone borrowers after <span lang="th">อํา</span></h2>

        <p>Sometimes, if the first syllable of a word has <span lang="th">อํา</span>, the second syllable will "borrow" its consonant class from the first consonant of the first syllable.</p>

        <p>In the word <span lang="th">ดำริ</span>, for instance, it's <span lang="th">ดำ-ริ</span>, but for this word specifically, we have to know that we pretend the <span lang="th">ริ</span> part starts with a mid-class consonant, because the first syllable starts with mid-class <span lang="th">ด</span>.</p>

        <p>There's no way to tell when this happens. Thankfully, it's super rare.</p>

        <div class="words">
