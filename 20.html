        <h1>Lesson 20</h1>

        <p>Last lesson! This rule is one of the hardest, and it's kind of unpredictable, so we've saved it for last. Last lesson, we looked at "normal" consonant clusters - the ones that behave.</p>

        <p>However, there's another kind of consonant cluster that I'm calling the "hidden-<span class="rom">a</span>" cluster. I'll show you with an example: <span lang="th">สมัย</span> <span class="rom">sàmǎi</span>.</p>

        <div class="questions">
            <details>
                <summary>At first glance, it looks like <span lang="th">สมัย</span> is a word we can read. What's weird about the pronunciation, <span class="rom">sàmǎi</span>?</summary>
                The tones are unexpected. This word looks like <span lang="th">ส-มัย</span> <span class="rom">sà-mai</span>. But the second syllable is <span class="rom">mǎi</span> with a rising tone instead.
            </details>
        </div>

        <p>So something's going on with that <span lang="th">สม</span> cluster. Here's how to read it:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>I look at the first consonant, <span lang="th">ส</span>. I imagine I add a short <span lang="th">อะ</span> to it and make <span lang="th">สะ</span> <span class="rom">sà</span>.</li>
            <li>I look at the class of the first consonant. <span lang="th">ส</span> is high-class.</li>
            <li>I read the rest of the syllable as normal, except I pretend that it starts with the class of the first consonant. So I read <span lang="th">มัย</span>, but when I figure out the tone, I pretend that the syllable starts with a high-class consonant. High-class consonant, live syllable, rising tone, so this is <span class="rom">mǎi</span>.</li>
            <li>I put the two parts together: <span class="rom">sàmǎi</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To recap - hidden-<span class="rom">a</span> clusters become two syllables. The first syllable is the first consonant plus <span lang="th">อะ</span>. The second syllable "borrows" its starting consonant class from the first consonant. (There is, of course, a very rare exception to this that I talk about in the <a href="epilogue.html#hiddena">epilogue</a>.)</p>
        
        <p>Usually, if you see a high-class consonant that's followed by a sonorant or "sing-y" sound, it's probably a hidden-<span class="rom">a</span> cluster. (Remember, the sonorants are <span class="rom">m n ng r l y w</span>.) Hidden-<span class="rom">a</span> clusters starting with mid-class consonants are less common, and hidden-<span class="rom">a</span> clusters starting with low-class consonants are very rare.</p>
        
        <p>This rule is annoying because there's nothing that tells you when it applies. For example, check out the word <span lang="th">สมณะ</span>. You might be tempted to say <span lang="th">สม</span> is a hidden-a cluster and get <span class="rom">sàmàná</span>. But nope! Instead of being a cluster, this <span lang="th">สม</span> is just two separate syllables: <span lang="th">ส-ม</span>. The word is <span class="rom">sàmáná</span>.</p>
        
        <p>Here's another example. The word <span lang="th">ปลัด</span> has a hidden-a cluster: <span class="rom">bpàlàt</span>. But there are plenty of words where ปล is just a "regular" cluster instead: <span lang="th">ปลูก</span>, <span lang="th">ปลา</span>, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I had to look pretty hard for those examples, though. In the real world, here's three things about words with hidden-<span class="rom">a</span> clusters:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>High-class consonant plus sonorant / "sing-y" sound <em>usually</em> equals hidden-<span class="rom">a</span> cluster. Especially <span lang="th">ส</span>. Hidden-<span class="rom">a</span> clusters love to start with <span lang="th">ส</span>.</li>
            <li>Because high and mid-class consonants plus <span lang="th">อะ</span> create low-tone syllables, the first syllable of a hidden-<span class="rom">a</span> cluster will almost always be low.</li>
            <li>In practice, you can kind of fudge the pronunciation. See how <span lang="th">สมัย</span> kind of looks like it's one syllable, <span class="rom">smǎi</span>? Especially when people talk quickly, this word can actually sound kind of like a one-syllable <span class="rom">s'mǎi</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>So - honestly - don't worry too much about this rule. It comes up in some common vocabulary, but once you know a word, you'll know what it sounds like, and you won't have to think through the rule every time.</p>
        
        <p>Why did this weird rule come about? Most of the words with this rule come from Khmer, which is spoken in Cambodia. Just like Sanskrit and Pali, Thai has a lot of Khmer words, and Khmer has a lot of consonant clusters that Thai doesn't let you say, so Thai just smooshed a little <span class="rom">a</span> sound in there.</p>
        
        <p>Try these words out. There's just a few of them for practice, and I promise each of them contains a hidden-<span class="rom">a</span> cluster. Because in the real world there's no telling when this rule applies, I really think that when you learn new vocabulary you should just learn these cases as they come.</p>
